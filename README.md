# Animated Bus Map

## The Animated Bus Map project was created for an MIT xPro Web Development course. 

### **Description:**  
After clicking on the button in the upper left corner, the map marker will move from one bus stop to the next one on it's travel on Massachusetts Avenue from MIT to Harvard.  I changed the mapbox styling to a satellite image allowing viewers to visualize the bus stop locations in relation to local landmarks.

### **Usage**
To view Animated Bus Map on your local machine, download the animatedMaps.html, mapAnimation.js and styles.css files into a folder and drag the animatedMaps.html into a web browser.

### **Roadmap of future improvements**
Additional features will be to have this bus tracker move all the way along Mass. Ave. from Harvard to the South End neighborhood in Boston.  It would also be helpful to have addresses of bus stops appear at each bus stop.

### **License Information**
The project is created under the MIT license.


# PacMan
<a href="http://jefejuell.github.io/PacMan"> PacMan Exercise </a> 
## The PacMan project was created for an MIT xPro Web Development course. 
  
### **Description:**  
PacMan should begin moving to the right until it detects the right bound of the webpage, at which point it should reverse direction.  It will repeat a similar process in the opposite direction until it reaches the left bound of the webpage.  It will go back and forth.  Of course, motion requires energy, so it will be eating invisible food as it travels repeatedly back and forth. 

### **Usage**
To view PacMan, download all files into a folder and drag the index.html into a web browser.

### **Sample**
