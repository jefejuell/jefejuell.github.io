# PacMan

## The PacMan project was created for an MIT xPro Web Development course. 
  
### **Description:**  
PacMan should begin moving to the right until it detects the right bound of the webpage, at which point it should reverse direction.  It will repeat a similar process in the opposite direction until it reaches the left bound of the webpage.  It will go back and forth.  Of course, motion requires energy, so it will be eating invisible food as it travels repeatedly back and forth.Usage: You can include examples of how to use your project in this section and highlight the expected outcomes.Roadmap: This section could include any future fixes or improvements you might be planning for your project. 


### **Usage**
To view PacMan, download all files into a folder and drag the index.html into a web browser.
