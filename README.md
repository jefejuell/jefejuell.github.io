# Stick Up - Neighborhood business

## The StickUp website pages were created by me to help my daughters earn money in the neighborhood. 
The Contact Us webpage has two interactive features.  One is where a customer clicks a button to get a quote. The other uses a client-side email app to send a message to the company.

### **Roadmap of future improvements**
The quote process will save the data submitted by each screen and send it to a location for storage and possibly also to the company.  Layout styles will be improved to make the website more attractive and user-friendly, especially for mobile devices. <br><br>

# Animated Bus Map
<a href="https://jefejuell.github.io/Animated-Bus-Map/"> Animated Bus Map <a/>

## The Animated Bus Map project was created for an MIT xPro Web Development course. 

### **Description:**  
After clicking on the button in the upper left corner, the map marker will move from one bus stop to the next one on it's travel on Massachusetts Avenue from MIT to Harvard.  I changed the mapbox styling to a satellite image allowing viewers to visualize the bus stop locations in relation to local landmarks.

### **Usage**
To view Animated Bus Map on your local machine, download the animatedMaps.html, mapAnimation.js and styles.css files into a folder and drag the animatedMaps.html into a web browser. Alternatively, you can click on the link above or go to https://jefejuell.github.io/Animated-Bus-Map 

### **Roadmap of future improvements**
Additional features will be to have this bus tracker move all the way along Mass. Ave. from Harvard to the South End neighborhood in Boston.  It would also be helpful to have addresses of bus stops appear at each bus stop.

### **License Information**
The project is created under the MIT license. <br><br>

# Eyes Exercise
<a href="https://jefejuell.github.io/Eyes/"> Eyes Exercise </a>

### **Description:**  
The eyeballs in these eyes will synchronously follow the mouse pointer wherever it moves.

### **Usage**
To view Eyes, download all files into a folder and drag the index.html into a web browser. Alternatively, you can click on the link above or go to https://jefejuell.github.io/Eyes 
  
### **Roadmap of future improvements**
Additional features will be to have the eyes have additional styling, as well as an event viewer that interacts with users when a certain screen location is reached.

### **License Information**
The project is created under the MIT license.<br><br>

# PacMen (multiple) Exercise
<a href="https://jefejuell.github.io/PacMen"> PacMen Exercise </a>

### **Description:**  
PacMen should create additonal PacMen when pressing the Add PacMan button.  Upon clicking the Start Game button, the Pacmen will move in random directions at random velocities until they detect a boundary of the webpage, at which point they will bounce off the edge.  Challenge: Try to get the PacMen to move faster.  Of course, motion requires energy, so the PacMen will be eating invisible food as they travel around. 

### **Usage**
To view PacMen, download all files into a folder and drag the index.html into a web browser. Alternatively, you can click on the link above or go to https://jefejuell.github.io/PacMen 

### **Roadmap of future improvements**
Additional features will be to modify the Start Game button so that it doesn't also act as an accelerator.  It will also be important to get the PacMen able to move normally if the viewing screen is resized (currently some can get stuck near the edges).

# PacMan
<a href="http://jefejuell.github.io/PacMan"> PacMan Exercise </a> 

## The PacMan project was created for an MIT xPro Web Development course. 
  
### **Description:**  
PacMan should begin moving to the right until it detects the right bound of the webpage, at which point it should reverse direction.  It will repeat a similar process in the opposite direction until it reaches the left bound of the webpage.  It will go back and forth.  Of course, motion requires energy, so it will be eating invisible food as it travels repeatedly back and forth. 

### **Usage**
To view PacMan, download all files into a folder and drag the index.html into a web browser.

### **Sample**
